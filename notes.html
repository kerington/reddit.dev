Accessors/Mutators are functions on models that run automatically for certain conditions

Get created_at timestamp from the DB and make sure to always output it in a format with the full name of the day

created_at YYYY-MM-DD:Hi:s

created_at data -> function -> output Wednesday, June 5th

Accessor is a function on a model that accesses data from that model's table and transforms it. This function is called automatically.

Mutator is a function on a model that fires a function automatically on a given property of the object in order to save a transformed version to the db table.

Hash::make("my-crummy-password")

Accessors run (automatically) on data after we access it from the DB
Mutators run (automatically) on data before we insety/update it into the DB
	- If you find yourself writing something over and over for the database, put it in a mutator!

----

public function getCreatedAtAttribute($value)
{
	$utc = \Carbon\Carbon::createFromFormat($this->getDateFormat(), $value);
	return $utc->setTimezone('America/Chicago');
}

How to build Relationships
------------------

Step 1:
	Stop and think and talk about the things you're relating.

1:1
username/password

1:Many
One User has many Posts
Each post belongs to one and only one user
(the table that is the many is the one that has the foreign key)

Many to Many
A single Blog Post has many Tags
A single Tag can have many Blog Posts
(the table that has foreign keys to both tags and posts is a new table called post_tag)

Step 2:
	Add necessary foreign keys and then specify them as such in migrations

Step 3:
	Go to the models and add relationship functions

EXAMPLE:

//on User.php
public function posts()
{
    return $this->hasMany('App\Models\Post', 'created_by');
}

// on Post.php
public function user()
{
return $this->belongsTo('App\User', 'created_by');
}


Punchline:

$post->user gets you the user object of that post

$user->posts gets you a collection of posts from that user.
